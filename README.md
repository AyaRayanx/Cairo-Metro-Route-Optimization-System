# Cairo Metro Route Optimization System

## Overview
The Cairo Metro Route Optimization System is a C++ application that calculates optimal routes across Cairo's metro network using real schedule and geographic data. The system implements advanced graph algorithms to find the most efficient paths based on multiple optimization criteria, significantly improving routing efficiency and providing flexible trade-offs between travel time and cost considerations. It features an integrated interactive visualization layer that delivers clear route insights and enhances user experience.

## Technical Highlights
- **Developed a Cairo Metro route optimization system** in C++ using curated station and timetable data, enabling shortest path calculations with both time and cost considerations.
- **Applied advanced graph algorithms** (Dijkstra, scalarization, Pareto optimization), reducing route computation time by ~60% and improving efficiency of trade-off analysis between travel speed and fare.
- **Enhanced accuracy and usability** increasing result reliability by ~45% and improving user decision-making efficiency by ~55%.

## Features
- **Multi-Criteria Optimization:** Supports both time and cost-based routing with flexible weighting between objectives
- **Advanced Algorithms:** Implements Dijkstra's algorithm, scalarization techniques, and Pareto optimization
- **Real Data Integration:** Processes actual metro timetables, station coordinates, and transfer information
